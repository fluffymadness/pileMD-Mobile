### PileMD Mobile

This is the Android Client of the PileMD project that
builds upon the folder structure of the desktop version of @MattNer0's fork
https://github.com/MattNer0/pilemd

It is intended to work with Syncthing as a Sync-Backend.

For now it builds and hast the following features

- basic folderbrowsing
- alphabetical sorting (racks, notebooks, notes)
- note-detail list-view
- basic note creation (no editing of created notes for now)

It is in alpha state, so some features are missing or do not work as expected.
